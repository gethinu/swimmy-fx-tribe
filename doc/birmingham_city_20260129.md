The Alchemy of Multibagger Stocks:  
An empirical investigation of factors that drive outperformance in the stock 
market

Abstract 
Hot growth stocks attract substantial interest from investors; however, future stock market winners are 
difficult to identify using traditional metrics of fundamental analysis (such as cash flow, profitability or 
earnings per share). This study investigates the characteristics of “multibagger stocks” – stocks that increase 
in value several times the original investment – and detects key drivers of their abnormal investment returns. 
An empirical analysis of 464 multibagger stocks listed on major American stock exchanges, each increasing 
in value by at least tenfold during 2009-2024, was conducted. A dynamic panel data model was developed 
to explain the sources of their outperformance and to predict future returns. The findings indicate that 
several traditional Fama-French factors, including size, value and profitability, remain significant predictors 
of future multibagger returns: small-cap high-value high-profitability stocks outperform. Additionally, the 
analysis identifies further important drivers of multibagger stock outperformance. These include 
fundamental, technical, and macroeconomic variables, such as high free cash flow yield, distinctive 
investment patterns linked to EBITDA growth, complex momentum effects with quick trend reversals that 
limit optimal entry points, and specific interest rate environment.  
This study advances asset pricing research by developing a novel, empirically validated model to explain 
the multibagger phenomenon. It offers valuable practical insights for investors and asset managers and 
provides a robust theoretical foundation for future stock screening strategies aimed at identifying potential 
multibaggers and maximising capital gains.

1. Introduction  
Background and context for the study 
Stock market investment represents a core component of financial markets and play an important role in 
life of modern society. Individual investors, asset managers and academic researchers are actively striving 
to discover investment strategies that generate superior returns. Despite extensive research on asset 
pricing and the determinants of stock performance, the systematic identification of future 
multibagger stocks remains one of the most sought-after yet challenging objective in the investment 
analysis. The term “multibagger”, popularised by Peter Lynch (1988), refers to a stock that appreciates 
multiple times over its initial price, usually within a relatively short period, and typically generates returns 
that significantly exceed market benchmarks1. For example, a “two-bagger” describes a stock that doubled 
in price while a “10-bagger” refers to a stock that increased in value tenfold, from $1 invested to $10.  
While the concept of multibaggers is widely recognised and actively used in investment practice, this 
type of stocks has received little attention from academic researchers. There is a considerable gap in 
academic literature on robust methods for identifying future multibagger opportunities and understanding 
determinants of their exponential growth using rigorous econometric methods. Traditional asset pricing 
theories, whether supporting the Efficient Market Hypothesis (Fama, 1970) or the contrarian Overreaction 
Hypothesis (De Bondt and Thaler, 1985), tend to focus on conventional return predictors such as firm size, 
value, profitability, and momentum. More recent studies extend factor models by incorporating more 
original explanatory factors, including behavioural biases, cognitive errors, and investor emotions (Ren, 
2024; Padmavathy, 2024). Despite these advances, academic literature has largely overlooked multibagger 
stocks as a distinct group: the asset pricing models are typically applied to broad stock markets, aiming to 
uncover general patterns in stock returns rather than to explains why certain stocks experience extreme 
capital appreciation and produce exceptional market-beating returns. As a result, the specific factors driving 
the abnormal multibagger returns remain largely unexplored.  
Furthermore, most insights on multibaggers originate from investment practitioners rather than academic 
empirical finance research (Phelps, 1972; Oswal, 2014; Martelli, 2014). While these studies offer useful 
heuristics for investment decision-making (for instance, strong earnings growth or above-average return 
on capital), they often lack necessary econometric rigour and empirical validation of statements made. 
In addition, prior research has not provided a clear, actionable framework for identifying future 
multibaggers ex ante. Finally, another notable gap is that most studies on multibagger stocks cover periods 
only up to 2014, overlooking structural changes in financial markets over the past decade, such as the 
explosive growth of disruptive technologies, macroeconomic and geopolitical shocks, which may have 
altered the drivers of stock market outperformance, making previous insights potentially obsolete and less 
relevant to the current market environment. Filling these gaps is essential for advancing academic finance 
and informing practical investment strategies. 
Research problem and rationale for the study 
The lack of attention from the academic community, insufficient empirical scrutiny and methodological 
flaws of existing practitioner research limit both theoretical advancements in asset pricing and practical 
applications for investors seeking to identify high-growth opportunities. 
The central research problem this study seeks to address is the absence of a robust, evidence-driven 
quantitative framework for identifying future multibagger stocks. Understanding the multibagger 
1The term originates from baseball where it refers to "bags" or "bases" that a player reaches (e.g., single-bagger, 
double-bagger) that reflect the success of their play.

phenomenon is essential as it both advances financial theory and has significant practical implications. 
Investors need a systematic method to identify potential future winners among thousands of listed stocks 
while reducing exposure to speculative investments that fail to maintain returns over the longer term and 
create undesirable portfolio volatility. Additionally, as financial market conditions constantly evolve, it is 
useful to verify whether traditional explanatory variables, such as the Fama-French size and value factors, 
continue to predict future performance reliably.  
Research aim and objectives 
This study addresses numerous gaps in existing literature by conducting a comprehensive empirical analysis 
of multibagger stocks listed on major U.S. exchanges over 25 years (from 2000 to 2024), developing a 
dynamic predictive model of multibagger returns, and identifying key fundamental, technical and 
macroeconomic determinants of their extraordinary growth. It aims to uncover the unique characteristics 
of multibagger stocks that drive their outperformance.  
To achieve this aim, this study pursues the following research objectives: 
1. To examine the fundamental and technical characteristics that distinguish multibagger stocks that 
increased in value by at least tenfold during the last 15 years from non-multibaggers. 
2. To evaluate the effectiveness of the traditional Fama-French five-factor model in explaining and 
predicting multibagger stock performance. 
3. To develop an enhanced dynamic econometric model that explains multibaggers’ performance and 
predicts their future returns by incorporating novel factors beyond those suggested by the traditional 
asset pricing theory. 
4. To analyse the impact of macroeconomic factors and broader market conditions on multibagger 
stocks returns and determine whether including macroeconomic variables, such as interest rates, 
improves the model’s predictive accuracy. 
5. To generate actionable insights for investors and contribute to asset pricing literature by advancing 
the understanding of multibagger phenomenon. 
The study attempts to answer the following research questions: 
1. What unique traits differentiate multibagger stocks from other equities? 
2. To what extent do conventional asset pricing factors (size, value, profitability, etc.) help to predict 
future returns of multibagger stocks? 
3. Are there additional variables, beyond those in the Fama-French factor model, that significantly 
enhance the ability to predict multibagger performance? 
4. How do macroeconomic conditions, such as the interest rate environments and business cycles, as 
well as overall stock market performance, affect multibagger stock returns? 
5. What practical insights can be derived from the findings to enable investors to identify potential 
future multibagger opportunities?

Paper structure 
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the existing literature, summarising 
key debates on the sources of market-beating stocks returns and focusing on prior research on multibagger 
stocks. It also highlights the limitations of existing studies on the subject and explains the author’s unique 
contribution to academic literature. Section 3 describes the data sources, sample selection criteria and 
rationale for the time period chosen for analysis. Sections 4 and 5 present the basic model and the 
methodology for further model development employed in the study. Section 6 discusses the empirical 
findings in detail, comparing the performance of the traditional five-factor Fama-French model with more 
refined static and dynamic frameworks specifically designed to explain and predict multibagger stock 
performance. Section 7 concludes with key takeaways, limitations, and directions for future research. 
2. Literature review  
Historic development of literature on multibagger stocks 
The first empirical studies on the most profitable investment strategies and stock-picking techniques 
dated back to the early 1930s. Wyckoff (1931) suggested a method of stock selection based on past price 
dynamics, volume analysis, and market psychology. His methodology focused on identifying accumulation 
and distribution phases within stock price cycles and entering positions before major price movements – 
the ideas that created a basis for modern technical trading. At the same time, Graham and Dodd (1934) laid 
grounds for fundamental stock market analysis, emphasising the importance of intrinsic value, margin of 
safety, and financial statement analysis to identify undervalued stocks overlooked by the market that are 
likely to deliver abnormal returns when their true value is recognised.  
Since then, numerous authors attempted to identify the type of stocks that generated market-beating 
returns for investors, detect their unique features and formulate other methods of successful stock 
selection. Alternative theoretical approaches and varied empirical evidence led to contradicting 
conclusions. The supporters of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (originated by Fama, 1970) argued that 
stock market prices accurately reflect all available information about listed companies and their prospects. 
Therefore, stocks always trade at their fair value, and it would not be feasible to find investment 
opportunities with above-average risk-adjusted returns by picking “the best stocks”. The advocates of the 
Overreaction Hypothesis point to plentiful observed cases of market inefficiencies caused by information 
asymmetries, market psychology, and irrational human behaviour and provide numerous examples of 
investment strategies that “beat the market”: starting from the foundation papers by De Bondt and Thaler 
(1985), Chopra et al. (1992) and Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) which all demonstrate that the recent history 
of a stock price movement is useful in predicting future returns and identifying potential outperformers, to 
recent studies by Singh and Kaur (2024), Zhang and Li (2024) that convincingly show that stocks that 
experienced extreme recent declines exhibit significant excess returns relative to the market in future 
periods. As will be shown later, this study provides further empirical evidence in support of the latter 
contrarian idea and demonstrates how existing market inefficiencies can be exploited for substantial 
investment gains. 
While the active discussion on sources of stock market outperformance produced numerous publications 
covering various geographic regions and time periods, a particular group of highest-performing 
multibagger stocks that generate market-beating returns has received little attention from the 
academic research community. There were limited attempts to find a formula for discovering potential 
future multibaggers using a bottom-up data-driven approach without assuming any theory. Only a few 
studies explicitly focused of identification of unique traits of the best stocks that outperformed the market 
4 
for a long time period – for example, studies of 10- and 100-baggers by Phelps (1972), later books and 
practitioner research by Oswal (2014), Martelli (2014) and Mayer (2018).  
The seminal study by Phelps’ (1972) focused on 100-baggers – stocks that grow to $100 for every $1 
invested. It analysed the period from 1932 to 1971, listed 365 stocks and attempted to uncover their 
common features using anecdotal examples and case studies. He suggested searching for small and 
relatively unknown companies that offer new products and new materials or exploit new production 
methods – things that help to solve problems and improve humans’ lives – with strong earnings growth, 
potential for further expansion, and sound management practices and holding them for extended periods 
avoiding overtrading. He summarised: 
“To make money in the stock market you must have the vision to see them, the courage to buy them 
and the patience to hold them. Patience is the rarest of all three.” (Phelps, 1972:8). 
Phelps’ research, although mainly descriptive rather than theoretical, became legendary in the investing 
community and laid grounds for further applied studies of multibaggers. Mayer (2018) applied Phelps’ 
methodology to analyse 100-baggers during the later period covering 1962-2014. He developed Phelps’ 
idea of long-term holding into a “coffee-can portfolio” approach where the best stocks are kept for at 
least 10 years. He also proposed focusing on stocks with the following features:  
▪ Extended periods of earnings growth accompanied by valuation multiples (P/E, P/S etc.) expansion. 
▪ Accelerating rather than steady growth in earnings is highly beneficial. 
▪ High ROE2 (exceeding 20%). 
▪ Owner operators: talented visionary CEO, high insider ownership. 
▪ Beaten-down and forgotten stocks after they turn around and return to profitability. 
▪ Small cap stocks rather than mega-caps as they have higher chances of becoming multi-baggers. 
The idea that smaller companies might generate higher investment returns compared to companies with 
high capitalisation due to the low base effect finds empirical support in many other studies, including well
known work by Fama and French (1993), numerous tests of their factor models using broad market data, 
and focused examination of the multibagger sample for size patterns by Martelli (2014). 
Oswal’s “Wealth creation” study (2014) attempted to build on Phelps and Mayer’s qualitative 
insights by conducting a basic statistical analysis of multibagger stocks. Oswal focused on the Indian 
stock market and identified 47 stocks whose value increased 100-fold during the previous 20 years. The 
technological sector was identified as the largest wealth-creating sector. The 100-baggers were also found 
in numerous other areas from pharmaceuticals, banks and consumer retail to auto and building materials 
manufacturers. Oswal found that the Indian stock market itself, represented by the BSE Sensex index, was 
a 100-bagger too: its value increased 100-fold over 27 years between 1979 and 2006 with a CAGR of almost 
19%. The average 100x period (i.e., time to achieve 100-fold returns) in India was found to be around 12 
years (equivalent to 47% CAGR return) – significantly shorter than in developed markets (26 years on 
average according to Mayer, 2018). Oswal recommended concentrating attention on small and relatively 
unknown companies with sustainable high growth in earnings and quality management which were trading 
at low single-digit P/E, calling his investment philosophy “QGLP” (Quality, Growth, Longevity, at 
reasonable Price). According to his analysis, the 100x phenomenon required both growth in earnings 
and expansion in valuation ratios. Oswald’s study concluded that to earn life-changing returns in the 
stock market, an investor should search for “growth in all dimensions – sales, margin and valuation” 
(Oswal, 2014:7). 
Similar ideas were promoted by the famous investor Peter Lynch who managed the world’s most 
profitable investment fund Fidelity Magellan. Lynch (1988, 1993) advocated the idea of “growth at 
reasonable prices” which allowed him to identify numerous multibaggers and grow assets under his

management from $18 million to $14 billion with an average annual return of 28.1% vs a market average 
of 9.1%. Using case studies and anecdotal evidence from his extensive investment practice, Lynch 
illustrates how these factors have historically contributed to significant outperformance of stocks in his 
portfolio. 
The existing publications in the domain appear to agree that a multibagger is created via the alchemy 
of the following elements:  
1. Size: company should be small and relatively unknown. 
▪ Size is a key driver of the low base effect to enable substantial future growth in market 
capitalisation. Company must be small both in terms of market cap and sales volume. 
▪ Analyst coverage and institutional holdings should be low, providing a chance to buy stocks 
below their intrinsic value. As a stock becomes popular, the market recognises its future growth 
potential and factors it into the stock price, thus, limiting future returns. 
▪ Relatively low trading volumes that provide further mispricing opportunities. 
2. High quality of business and management team. 
▪ Proven business model required; company must be able to generate high ROE/ROCE relative to 
industry average. 
▪ Wise capital allocation decisions: ability to reinvest at ROIC well above market average for 
exceedingly long time with the potential to compound growth over a sufficient period to create 
abnormally outsized returns. 
▪ Low intensity of competition and industry tailwinds are highly desirable. Company must be 
growing to become a market leader (among top 3) in their respective business. 
▪ Company must have a “moat” (as per Warren Buffett) – i.e., sustainable competitive advantage 
and ability to protect its competitive position from potential threats. 
▪ Asset-light business model is advantageous, as it allows a company to avoid significant 
maintenance CAPEX commitments. 
▪ A close alignment of management priorities with shareholder interests is necessary to convert 
company growth into share price growth. 
3. Growth in all its dimensions: sales, cash flow, profit margins, valuation multiples. 
▪ Earnings per share (EPS) growth is an absolute must and non-negotiable. 
▪ EPS growth should preferably be combined with growth in ROE. 
4. Longevity of growth:  
▪ Company must have a large growth pathway ahead: high addressable market and low current 
market penetration with numerous opportunities to expand operations. 
▪ Growth must be consistent across economic and market cycles (usually implying non-cyclical 
business). 
5. Favourable valuation at time of purchase: future growth potential must not be fully reflected in the 
purchase price. 
▪ Low P/E, PEG, and other valuation ratios at entry point. 
▪ Outsized share price growth can be achieved via a combination of growth in two elements: 
earnings and valuation. This can easily be shown mathematically: as share price (P) can be 
decomposed into a product of earnings per share (EPS) times market value of each $ of earnings 
(P/E ratio):

�
�ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒
𝐸𝑎𝑟𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒
= 𝐸𝑃𝑆 ×𝑃/𝐸 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜, 
hence, taking logs and differentiating with respect to time produces:

▪ Therefore, valuation multiple expansion to support earnings per share growth is also necessary to 
achieve outstanding investment returns (occasionally called “twin engines” of share price growth – Mayer, 2015:179). 
Limitations of existing studies and author’s unique contribution to literature 
The consensus among authors suggests that winning stocks that deliver market-beating returns share some 
common features. However, the existing studies suffer from several limitations. 
First, most of the features of multibaggers stocks suggested by previous publications lack rigorous 
empirical validation. The insights, rather than being derived from methodical quantitative analysis, 
frequently rely on anecdotal examples or selective case studies that may not be representative of broader 
market trends. As this paper will demonstrate, when the proposed characteristics are subjected to statistical 
testing, they frequently fail to hold (for example, most notably, the need for EPS growth which is treated 
as an axiom by the existing literature). The lack of empirical testing highlights the need for a more 
systematic data-driven approach to identifying the true determinants of multibagger stock outperformance, 
which this paper will implement. 
Second, when attempts at empirical analysis of existing multibaggers are made, they tend to be 
predominantly descriptive rather than analytical. For instance, Mayer (2018) reports average values for 
P/E ratio, EPS growth rates, and total returns for multibagger stocks in his sample, while Oswal (2014) 
classifies firms into lists such as ten largest value creators, ten fastest or the most consistent value creators. 
While these studies provide retrospective snapshots of past multibagger firms’ performance, they do not 
investigate the underlying factors that contributed to their outstanding stock appreciation. Critically, none 
of the existing studies in this niche area attempt to employ sophisticated econometric techniques to uncover 
determinants that drive abnormal stock returns or to test their statistical significance. Without a robust 
econometric framework, it is unclear whether previously observed characteristics of multibagger stocks are 
relevant for different market conditions or whether they are simply coincidental. Moreover, reliance on 
basic descriptive statistics without controlling for other influences makes any causal inferences unreliable, 
limiting practical applicability of these studies in investment practice. This lack of analytical depth 
represents a critical shortcoming in existing literature, which will be explicitly rectified in this study. 
Third, many existing publications on the subject, both academic or practitioner, do not provide clear 
actionable criteria for stock selection, as their proposed multibagger identifying methods are 
subjective, difficult to quantify, and problematic to implement in practice. Many authors and 
investment experts provide qualitative heuristics, but their guidance is often vague. For example, the 
legendary Peter Lynch recommends choosing “a simple business with a boring name, doing something off
putting” (Lynch, 1989:131) – a fascinating advice, which unfortunately lacks quantifiable parameters and 
is open to subjective interpretation. Some studies solely rely on the analysis of the subjective statements as 
their key research method. For instance, Chauhan et al. (2022) attempts to identify the factors influencing 
the selection of multibaggers stocks and establish their hierarchy of importance based on the analysis of 15 
semi-structured interviews with industry experts; however, the inherently subjective nature of this approach 
and the absence of empirical validation using actual stock market data limit the robustness and 
generalizability of their findings. Furthermore, frequently mentioned attributes such as “high quality of 
7 
management” or “wise capital allocation decisions” can only be appraised retrospectively, once share price 
growth has already occurred, thereby reducing their practical utility for stock selection. Similarly, 
predicting the longevity of a company’s “growth pathway ahead” is inherently challenging, particularly 
given the current rapid rate of technological advancements. The reliance on subjective judgments and 
qualitative heuristics in existing literature reveals the need for a quantifiable objective framework to guide 
investors in selecting potential future multibaggers – an approach this study seeks to develop. 
Fourth, existing studies cover various time periods up to 2014 only, leaving a significant gap in the 
analysis of more recent multibagger stocks. The explosive rise of new industries, such as artificial 
intelligence, renewable energy, gene therapy, autonomous vehicles, blockchain and digital finance, due to 
disruptive technological progress during the past decade, suggests that the factors contributing to 
multibagger performance may have evolved. Moreover, during the recent years the global financial markets 
have been shaken not only by the unprecedented technological advancements but also by significant 
macroeconomic and political disruptions, such as the Brexit referendum, COVID-19 pandemic, consequent 
inflation surge and interest rate hikes, US-China trade wars, Russia-Ukraine war and Middle East conflicts, 
which all may have caused considerable shifts in investor behaviour. All these factors could have influenced 
the characteristics of multibagger stocks and drivers of their returns, raising questions whether the existing 
research based on outdated observations still provides relevant insights for contemporary investors. It is 
important to examine whether the patterns identified in earlier studies are still valid in the current market 
environment. This is an obvious gap which this research will address. 
Next, several additional articles retrieved using the search term “multibaggers” predominantly 
consist of low-quality student papers and blog posts published by investment companies. These sources 
often employ flawed methodologies (for example, suffer from spurious regression issues – see Gunasekaran 
et al., 2024) and offer unverifiable investment recommendations (Alta Fox Capital, 2021; Wright Research, 
2021), rendering them unsuitable for reliable academic analysis. 
Furthermore, the majority of available publications, aside from the seminal works of Lynch, Phelps 
and Mayer, exclusively focus of Indian equities (eg., Oswal, 2014; Chauhan et al., 2022, among others). 
Consequently, the insights derived from these studies, based on a narrowly defined sample, may have 
limited applicability to developed stock markets, where regulatory frameworks, macroeconomic conditions, 
market dynamics, and investor behaviour differ significantly. 
This paper will attempt to fill all above-mentioned research gaps. It will explicitly focus on identifying 
quantifiable features of multibagger stocks that drive their abnormal returns using robust panel data 
econometric modelling process covering more recent period of 2009-24 that was not examined in previous 
studies. The findings from this investigation have significant practical value as they can be converted in a 
practical stock screener which can be used to analyse the existing stock universe and identify companies 
with similar characteristics with the potential to generate similar multibagger returns in the future. 
3. Data 
Time period 
The analysis in this paper uses data on all companies listed in major American stock exchanges (the NYSE 
and NASDAQ), including ADRs, sourced from the S&P Capital IQ database. The total share price returns 
of all listed companies were calculated for a 15-year period (from 1 January 2009 to 1 January 2024). This 
period was selected for analysis because it begins at the market low immediately following the end of the 
previous bear market caused by the global financial crisis of 2007-08 (Figure 1). This event effectively 
“reset” the market, initiating a new market cycle. A 15-year window is sufficiently long to allow high
8 
growth companies to demonstrate their full potential and is commonly used in existing studies. Moreover, 
excluding earlier market cycles (pre-2009) reduces the impact of legacy high-performers from more 
traditional industries (e.g., from the dot.com era or earlier) and maintains focus on companies and their 
characteristics that are more relevant for success in the current market environment.

Furthermore, the selected time period captures a broad range of market conditions and significant 
economic events, making it highly suitable for analysis. During this observation period, the U.S. stock 
market has experienced substantial volatility and has been affected by numerous shocks, including:  
▪ Internal political disturbances: Market-moving U.S. presidential elections (2016, 2020 and 2024). 
▪ Global geopolitical tensions and international events: Brexit referendum (2016), U.S.-China trade 
war (2018), Russia-Ukraine war (ongoing since 2022), and ongoing conflicts in Israel and the 
Middle East. 
▪ Commodity price shocks: Sharp oil price declines (2014-16 and 2020) and surges (2022-23); global 
food price crises (2010-12, 2022-23); precious metals price shocks (2011, 2020). 
▪ Macroeconomic shocks and policy shifts: European debt crisis (2010), U.S. debt ceiling crises 
(2011, 2023) and a credit rating downgrade (2011), inflation surge (2021), and Federal Reserve 
emergency interest rates cuts (2020) and hikes (2021). 
▪ Financial sector disruptions: Flash crush (2010), banking crisis (2023), and the approval of Bitcoin 
ETFs (2024). 
▪ Other global crises: COVID-19 pandemic (2020). 
The observation period covers two recessions (2009 and 2020) and consequent recoveries, periods of 
increasing and declining interest rates (analysed in detail in section 6.5), three bull and three bear markets 
with periods of S&P 500 index gains of 63-400% and declines of 25-57%, thus, providing an excellent data 
range for examining stock performance across diverse market conditions.  
9 
Sample selection and dataset construction 
During the observation period, over five hundred enduring 10-baggers – i.e., stocks that increased in value 
tenfold3 or more between 2009 and 2024 and maintained this level at the end of the observation period – 
were identified. Companies that temporarily achieved tenfold returns but later dropped below the 900% 
return threshold (“transitory” multibaggers – Oswal, 2014) were excluded. Additionally, firms with missing 
fundamental data were also removed from the sample.  
The resulting panel dataset consists of 464 firms and includes various characteristics of these companies 
over a 25-year period (1 January 2000 to 1 January 2024). In other words, the dataset also examines the 
history of these multibaggers preceding their exceptional growth. Selected descriptive statistics for 
companies in the sample and other descriptive data, including sector distribution and time required to 
achieve tenfold share price appreciation are presented in the Appendix (Tables A2-A4). 
4. Model  
The starting point for the analysis is the five-factor model (Fama and French, 2015) which postulates 
that the expected future stock return is a function of several variables: 
�
�𝑖𝑡 −𝑅𝐹𝑡 = 𝑎𝑖 +𝑏𝑖(𝑅𝑀𝑡 −𝑅𝐹𝑡)+𝑠𝑖𝑆𝑀𝐵𝑡 +ℎ𝑖𝐻𝑀𝐿𝑡 +𝑟𝑖𝑅𝑀𝑊𝑡 +𝑐𝑖𝐶𝑀𝐴𝑡 +𝑒𝑖𝑡, 
where: 
�
�𝑖𝑡 is the return on a stock or portfolio i for period t. 
�
�𝐹𝑡 is the risk-free return, commonly proxied by one- or three-month Treasury bill rate. 
�
�𝑀𝑡 is the market return, proxied by a rate of return on a market index such as the S&P 500. 
(2) 
�
�𝑀𝐵𝑡 is the size factor: ‘Small Minus Big’, calculated as the difference between the returns on 
diversified portfolios of small-cap and big-cap stocks. 
�
�𝑀𝐿𝑡 is the value factor: ‘High Minus Low’, calculated at the difference in returns between high 
and low book-to-market (B/M) stocks. 
�
�𝑀𝑊𝑡 is the profitability factor: ‘Robust Minus Weak’, calculated as the difference in returns 
between stocks with robust and weak profitability. 
�
�𝑀𝐴𝑡 is the investment factor: ‘Conservative Minus Aggressive’, calculated as the difference in 
returns between stocks with low and high investment levels. 
�
�𝑖 measures the sensitivity of a stock’s return to the overall market return, reflecting its 
idiosyncratic risk. 
�
�𝑖, ℎ𝑖, 𝑟𝑖, 𝑐𝑖 measure the relevant factors exposures or payoffs. 
�
�𝑖 is the intercept term that is expected to be zero if the exposures to the five factors fully capture 
all variation in expected stock returns.

In other words, according to Fama and French, expected stock returns depend on the performance of the 
broad market (or market risk premium) and a stock’s exposure to size, value, profitability, and investment 
factors. The model suggests that firms with smaller size, higher value, stronger profitability, and 
conservative investment pattern tend to outperform in the long run. 
Empirical tests of the Fama-French five-factor model typically follow a two-step process. First, portfolios 
are created from independent stock sorts into groups according to each factor and average returns are 
calculated. This analysis identifies and isolates each factor’s premium in stock returns, controlling for other 
factors. The second step involves estimating the regression model (2), evaluating the significance of 
individual coefficients, assessing overall model performance, and comparing alternative specifications.  
5. Method 
This paper builds on the conventional analytical approach described above as a foundation and 
extends it by developing a more sophisticated dynamic panel model that incorporates factors unique to 
multibagger stocks. The sequential steps of the model development from the standard Fama-French 
equation (2) to the proposed model of multibagger stock returns are illustrated in the diagram below.

Figure 2. The modelling process: from Fama-French five-factor model to the dynamic panel model 
Following the Fama-French methodology, companies in the sample were independently sorted into several 
quantiles (data on 1 January for the period 2000-24 were used):  
▪ 3 groups by size (Small, Medium and Big) based on market capitalisation data. 
▪ 3 groups by value (Low, Medium and High) using B/M ratios, calculated as total equity/market cap. 
▪ 2 groups by profitability (Robust and Weak) measured as operating profit divided by book equity. 
▪ 2 groups by investment (Conservative and Aggressive), proxied as the annual percentage change 
in total assets. 
The intersection of size, value, profitability, and investment groups is used to create 36 portfolios from 
3×3×2×2 individual sorts. The first letter in each portfolio name refers to the size factor, the second letter 
denotes value group, the third letter reflects profitability, and the fourth letter describes the investment 
group. For instance, the SHRA portfolio consists of stocks of small-cap companies (S), with high book-to
market value (H), robust operating profitability (R), and aggressive investment strategy (A). The number 
of groups and portfolios is commonly chosen based on the available sample size to ensure sufficient 
diversification in the resulting portfolios. Typically, 2-5 groups are created for each factor (see Fama and 
French, 2017; Foye, 2018, for examples). The sample for the sorting process in this paper includes 10,740 
company-years, with created portfolios sizes ranging from 67 to 774 observations, providing an adequate 
sample size for meaningful statistical analysis.  
11 
Future (next year) actual and excess returns above the S&P 500 index are calculated for each stock, and the 
returns are then aggregated at the portfolio level. The results are reported in Tables 1 and 2 below. Panel A 
presents annual excess returns along with additional descriptive statistics for each portfolio, providing a 
clearer picture of the type of stocks sorted into each portfolio. Three additional panels (B, C, and D) report 
actual (rather than excess) annual price returns, as well as median (rather than mean) returns. A colour
coded scale is used to visualise the extent of portfolio outperformance: greener shades indicate higher 
returns, while redder shades represent weaker performance. The estimated regression model (equation 2) is 
presented in Table 3 and discussed in the section 6.2.

6. Results and discussion of findings 
6.1. Analysis of 3×3×2×2 sorts 
Size effect 
When controlling for value, profitability and investment factors, the size effect is evident: small-cap stocks 
outperform medium and large companies in 11 out of 12 cases, except for the SNWC, MNWC, and 
BNWC portfolios in column 5 (Table 1). The average values in column 13 demonstrate this pattern clearly: 
large firms (with an average market capitalisation of approximately $32 billion) outperform the market by 
9.7% annually, mid-sized firms (with an average capitalisation of $2 billion) by 14.5%, while small 
companies (with a market cap below $250 million) achieve an average excess return of 37.7% per year. 
However, when median values are considered instead of means, the results become less conclusive. Panel 
B (reported in Appendix) shows that four small-cap portfolios (SLWC, SLWA, SLRC, and SNWC) and 
two medium-sized portfolios (MLWC and MNWC) exhibit negative median excess returns. Some of these 
portfolios not only trail the market but also experience an actual decline in share prices, generating losses 
for investors. This suggests that small-cap classification alone is not a sufficient condition for 
outperformance, as other factors have a significant impact on stock returns. In all instances of 
underperformance mentioned above, the most apparent explanatory factor is the value effect. 
13 
Value effect 
Companies were sorted into value groups according to their book-to-market ratios, calculated as total equity 
divided by market capitalisation. A low book-to-market value (B/M < 1), i.e., low equity and relatively 
high market cap, implies that investors are paying more for a company than its net assets are worth. 
Notably, two portfolios within the low-value group (small-cap SLWC and SLWA) include companies with 
negative equity, meaning that their total liabilities exceed company assets. The average B/M ratio for the 
low-value group is only 0.06, implying that the intrinsic value of these companies is approximately 6% of 
what investors are paying for them, confirming their extreme overvaluation. 
On the contrary, a high book-to-market ratio (B/M > 1), i.e., high equity and relatively low market 
cap, indicates that the book value of a company exceeds the market price of its shares. The average 
B/M ratio for portfolios in the high-value group is 1.10, suggesting that these companies are undervalued 
by the market and their shares trade at a 10% discount relative to their intrinsic value.  
For a rational investor, it appears logical to invest in stocks offering strong fundamental value and avoid or 
sell overvalued or negative-equity stocks. The empirical data on excess returns confirm that the value effect 
is present among multibagger stocks: within each size group, high-value companies consistently 
generate superior returns. As the lowest row of panel A indicates, on average, low-value multibagger 
stocks outperform the S&P 500 by 12.8% annually, medium-value stocks by 14.5%, while high value 
portfolios generate 34.7% excess price return annually, demonstrating an obvious positive relationship 
between B/M value and stock performance. 
When controlling for size, profitability, and investment factors, the value effect remains consistently present 
across all portfolio sorts. For instance, comparing the average excess return for companies with weak 
profitability and a conservative investment policy (columns 1, 5, and 9) demonstrates a clear trend (the 
relevant section of panel A is reproduced below for clarity). One can see that low book-to-market firms 
generate an annual excess return of -5.4%, medium-value firms -2.1%, while high-value firms achieve 
23.6%. Companies with robust profitability demonstrate a similar pattern: 7.7%, 9.6% and 23.1% (columns 
3, 7, and 11 respectively), demonstrating that higher B/M ratios are associated with greater excess return. 
The same trend is observed among companies with aggressive investment policies.  
Although the pattern is not perfectly linear in mean values (e.g., the medium-value SNWC portfolio 
underperforms the low-value SLWC portfolio), it becomes perfectly consistent when median values are 
considered instead (see Table 1 Panel B). In other words, when controlling for other factors, all high
value portfolios consistently outperform medium-value portfolios, which, in turn, outperform low
value company groups. 
14 
It should also be noted that all portfolios which generated negative annual price returns (as shown in 
columns 1 and 5 of panels C and D) belong to low or medium value groups and suffer from low profitability 
and lack of investment. According to the descriptive statistics in panel A, a combination of a book-to
market value above 0.40 and positive operating profitability classifies a company into a portfolio with 
significantly higher chances of positive excess returns and a reduced likelihood of losses for investors. This 
insight has practical implications, as it can be used to develop effective screens for stock picking. 
The sorting process not only identifies which types of stocks have the potential to outperform 
(characterised by strong size and value factors) but also highlights which stocks to avoid or sell short. 
The analysis of median values, which prove more insightful than means, reveals that having a low book
to-market value and weak profitability poses a greater risk to small-cap stocks (as shown in column 1 of 
panel D). For example, portfolios with weak profitability not only underperform the S&P 500, generating 
negative excess returns, but also experience share price declines of 18.1%, 9.4%, and 7.6% annually for 
small-, medium-, and large-cap stocks respectively, indicating that the smaller the company, the more 
severe the losses for investors. Therefore, risk-averse investors should consider avoiding these types of 
stocks. Alternatively, given the extent of their underperformance, stocks with these characteristics (negative 
equity with B/M ≤ 0, negative operating profitability, and a small market cap below $200 million) might 
be considered for short strategies.  
Profitability effect 
The profitability effect is also present in the sample of multibagger stocks: controlling for other factors, 
portfolios with weak profitability generate lower excess returns compared to portfolios with robust 
profitability (for example, the averages are 9.6% vs. 16.0% for low B/M groups, 9.8% vs. 19.2% for 
medium value groups, and 28.5% vs. 40.9% for high-value companies). The same pattern can be seen when 
comparing other portfolio pairs. For example, portfolios with weak profitability and conservative 
investment policies generate -5.4%, -2.1%, and 23.6% returns (columns 1, 5, and 9 in panel A, reproduced 
below) and significantly higher returns of 7.7%, 9.6%, and 23.1% when they exhibit robust profitability 
(columns 3, 7, and 11). This tendency is observed in 22 out of 27 individual comparisons in panel A (82% 
of cases). 
The analysis of median values and actual annual price returns reiterates the previous conclusion. In 7 out 
of 8 cases of negative excess returns (panel B) and in all 4 out of 4 cases of actual negative price returns 
(panel D), the companies exhibited weak operating profitability (columns 1, 2, and 5). According to the 
descriptive statistics data, the mean operating profitability for these eight portfolios amounts to -9.6%, 
emphasising the importance of avoiding loss-making companies for investors who aim to outperform the 
market. 
15 
Investment effect 
Additionally, it is worth noting that all loss-making portfolios with negative price returns mentioned above 
(SLWC, MLWC, BLWC, and SNWC in panels C and D) share another common feature beyond weak 
profitability – they all adhere to a conservative investment approach. Their average year-on-year growth 
of assets is negative (-6.8% compared to +40.0% for similar companies in the higher investment quantile). 
In other words, their total assets are shrinking; these companies are not investing enough even to maintain 
their existing production capabilities, let alone expand their assets and create the foundation for future 
growth. This underinvestment, likely caused by weak profitability (-17.9% on average), serves as a red flag 
for stock investors, pinpointing companies to avoid or potentially short sell. This observation highlights the 
importance of robust investment in company assets to remain competitive and potentially deliver high 
future share price returns, becoming multibaggers, – the finding which contradicts the propositions of the 
five-factor model. 
According to Fama and French (2015), the investment factor coefficient should be negative; that is, a more 
aggressive investment rate (year-on-year growth of total assets) leads to lower future share price returns. 
Using data on stocks traded on the NYSE from 1963 to 2013, Fama and French found empirical evidence 
that the investment factor is statistically significant and particularly important for small-cap stocks, as 
portfolios of small-cap firms that invest aggressively despite weak profitability, tend to underperform the 
most. However, in the sample of multibagger stocks analysed in this paper, the pattern is strikingly different. 
Controlling for other factors, pairwise comparisons of conservative and aggressive investment portfolios 
show higher average returns for companies with higher asset growth. For example, in panel A, the 
mean excess returns for portfolios with weak profitability and conservative investment are -5.4%, -2.1%, 
and 23.6%, compared to 24.6%, 21.7%, and 33.4% respectively for companies with similar profitability 
and other characteristics but a high investment rate. This pattern is observed across all 24 possible pairwise 
comparisons of portfolios with varying sizes, values, and profitability levels within the table. 
This is a distinctive feature of multibagger stocks, not observed in other empirical studies based on 
less restricted samples of stocks. The persistence of the investment effect in all 100% of cases suggests that 
to outperform the market and potentially become a multibagger, companies need to aggressively 
invest in future growth. 
16 
Summary of key findings from Fama-French sorts 
The stock sorting exercise demonstrates that all conventional Fama-French variables considered to be the 
main drivers of stock returns in existing asset pricing literature – size, valuation, profitability, and 
investment – play an important role in driving the returns of multibagger stocks. 
▪ Size effect: small-cap stocks outperform medium and large companies. 
▪ Value effect: companies with a high book-to-market ratio outperform. 
▪ Profitability effect: companies with robust profitability outperform. 
▪ Investment effect: companies with aggressive investment strategies outperform.  
The relative importance of these factors, along with their statistical significance and predictive power, will 
be tested more formally within the panel regression framework in the next section. 
6.2. Regression analysis: original and upgraded five-factor models 
Standard Fama-French regression estimation and results 
In the next stage, annual data on 464 multibagger companies for the period 2000-2024 (11,600 company
year observations) were used to estimate the pooled regression with panel-corrected errors for the following 
model:  
�
�𝑖𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛾1𝑅𝑀𝑡 + 𝛾2𝑅𝐹𝑡 +𝛾3𝑆𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑖.𝑡−1 +𝛾4𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒𝑖,𝑡−1 +𝛾5𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑖,𝑡−1 +
𝛾6𝐼𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖,𝑡−1 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡, 
where: 
(3) 
�
�𝑖𝑡 is the annual price return on a stock i for period t (dividend yield is ignored). 
�
�𝑀𝑡 is market return on the S&P 500 index, and 𝑅𝐹𝑡 is risk-free return on the three-month T-bill, 
both common across companies and varying over time. 
�
�𝑖𝑧𝑒, 𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒,𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦,and 𝐼𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 are factors proxied by the log of market cap, B/M 
value, operating profitability, and year-on-year assets growth, varying across companies and over 
time. 
The actual values of these variables were used rather than differences between the top and bottom quantiles 
as in the original Fama and French paper (2015) to improve clarity of interpretation. To mitigate potential 
endogeneity within the set of independent variables, lagged values were used as predictors for future stock 
returns. Generalized Least Squares (GLS) rather than Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimator was used to 
account for heteroscedasticity in the data. The estimation results are reported in Table 3 below. 
All coefficients in the estimated pooled regression are statistically significant and have the expected 
signs, as discovered during the sorting stage. However, the operating profitability coefficient is close to 
zero (0.001), implying a minimal impact on future stock returns. The market return coefficient equals 1.82, 
signalling that multibagger stocks have high CAPM betas, while the risk-free return has a negative 
coefficient of -2.91, which is expected (the higher the return on risk-free assets, the lower the incentive to 
take on additional risk). 
17 
Table 3. Fama-French five-factor model: GLS pooled regression estimation 
The issue with this model lies in the intercept term size. According to Fama and French (2015), if an asset 
pricing model completely captures expected returns, the estimated intercept term should be 
indistinguishable from zero. They reject this hypothesis in their own paper, however. In our sample of 
multibagger stocks, the intercept term is extremely high and strongly statistically significant (83.9 with a 
p-value of 0.000). Thus, according to Fama-French criteria, the five-factor model fails to fully capture 
the expected returns when applied to multibagger stocks. A significant proportion of share price growth 
remains unexplained by the proposed factors, suggesting the existence of additional variables that drive the 
stock returns of these companies. This is why the conventional five-factor model was modified and 
extended. The next section will describe how the inclusion of additional explanatory variables improves 
model performance. 
Upgraded Fama-French factor model estimation and results 
In order to improve model fit, alternative metrics were tested as proxies for size (market cap, total 
enterprise value, total assets, total equity, total capital, total sales, and size classification dummy), valuation 
(book-to-market, price-to-earnings, and price-to-sales ratios), profitability (operating profit margin, net 
profit margin, EBITDA margin, return on capital, return on equity), and investment (in addition to asset 
growth, new dummy variables were created by comparing the company's asset growth with EBITDA and 
free cash flow growth). The models were evaluated based on the individual and joint significance of 
coefficients, as well as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Schwarz Bayesian Criterion (SBC) 
(Akaike, 1974; Schwarz, 1978). Both criteria provide a systematic way to compare alternative 
specifications and select the best-fitting model, accounting for model complexity and the number of 
parameters. The model with the lowest AIC and SBC was selected as an 'upgraded' version of the traditional 
Fama-French model for multibagger stocks, as reported in Table 4 below. 
18 
Table 4. Comparison of regression results for the standard Fama-French five-factor model and its 
upgraded version (fixed effect panel models) 
Apart from changes in the set of explanatory variables, alternative functional forms were evaluated for an 
upgraded panel model (pooled vs. fixed effects vs. random effects). The optimal choice of functional 
form was determined using conventional tests. According to the Breusch and Pagan Lagrangian 
Multiplier test (prob = 0.186), the null hypothesis of zero variance in the individual error term cannot be 
rejected, indicating that the random effect model is inappropriate, while pooled regression might be 
adequate. However, the F-test, which assesses whether all individual effects are zero (prob = 0.000), 
indicates that individual company dummies are jointly significant, rejecting pooled OLS in favour of the 
fixed effects model. The Hausman test, with a prob=0.000, also confirms that the fixed effect model is 
consistent and preferred over the random effects model. 
As can be seen, three variables in the new model were replaced with alternative metrics: total enterprise 
value (TEV) was used instead of market cap as a measure of size, price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) was used 
instead of book-to-market as a valuation measure, and EBITDA margin replaced operating profitability. 
All are significant at the 1% level, have the expected signs, and reflect the factor effects explained 
previously. Controlling for other variables, larger company size reduces future expected returns, while 
higher profitability and strong asset growth increase expected returns. A high P/E ratio implies that the 
company is overvalued (investors pay more for company earnings), therefore, it is equivalent to a low B/M 
value, leading to lower future stock returns (hence, the P/E coefficient is expected to have a negative sign). 
Apart from these replacements, a new Inv dummy variable was introduced (=1 if the asset growth rate 
exceeds the EBITDA growth rate), which turned out to be highly significant. The estimated coefficient is  -22.789, implying that when a company expands its assets at a rate exceeding its EBITDA growth, the stock 
price return for the following year tends to be 22.8 percentage points lower. In other words, multibagger 
stocks exhibit a unique investment pattern that distinguishes them from other stocks: they must invest 
aggressively but also require sufficient EBITDA growth to make the investment affordable and sustainable. 
These changes in model specification led to noticeable improvements. While R² is not directly interpretable 
as a measure of goodness of fit in panel models, both AIC and SBC information criteria are significantly 
lower in the upgraded version, reflecting an improved model fit. The coefficient for the profitability factor, 
19 
which was very close to zero (at 0.002) in the standard model, is now drastically higher (at 0.709) in the 
revised model, where operating profit margin has been replaced with EBITDA profitability as a regressor. 
This change implies a more meaningful impact on future stock returns. Additionally, the intercept term is 
significantly lower, indicating that the explanatory factors in the upgraded model more effectively 
capture variations in future stock returns compared to the original version of the FF5 model. 
6.3. Static and dynamic models of multibagger returns: estimation and 
analysis of results 
General-to-specific modelling process 
At the next stage, to estimate a more comprehensive model that explains the future returns of multibagger 
stocks with additional explanatory variables added to the Fama-French set of factors, Hendry’s general
to-specific modelling methodology was employed. This approach, which has proven to be highly popular 
in empirical studies, aims to uncover the optimal dynamic structure of the data without imposing any 
restrictive assumptions on what the true model specification might be. (For a detailed theoretical 
description see Hendry’s seminal work (1995) or the later review of available literature by Campos (2005)). 
This approach offers significant advantages in empirical research, ensuring that the resulting model is 
parsimonious, data-driven, and statistically robust. This is particularly relevant and effective for a study 
aimed at identifying the most influential factors driving multibagger stock returns, as it provides the 
opportunity to evaluate the effects of the widest range of potential explanatory variables. 
The general-to-specific modelling methodology involves starting with a general model that captures the 
underlying data generation process and progressively simplifying it to a more specific, parsimonious form 
without losing essential information. Initially, the regression model is over-parameterised by introducing a 
generous number of explanatory variables and lags for both dependent and explanatory variables on the 
right-hand side of the equation. Simplifications of the general model are then conducted through a series of 
reductions in lag lengths and the exclusion of insignificant variables one by one. In the first stage, the least 
statistically significant coefficient with the highest p-value is eliminated, and the model is re-estimated. In 
the second stage, the next variable with the least statistically significant coefficient is removed, and the 
model is re-estimated again. This process is repeated until a parsimonious model, which contains only a set 
of statistically significant regressors, exhibits good statistical properties, and remains reasonably stable over 
time, is obtained. After the elimination process is complete, the variable deletion F-test is implemented to 
evaluate the overall significance of the excluded variables to ensure against imposing invalid restrictions. 
The resulting parsimonious model is then used for further analysis, forecasting, hypothesis testing, 
simulations, and other research purposes.  
The variables included in the over-parameterised regression were chosen based on several 
considerations: theoretical suggestions from existing literature on factors that might drive multibagger 
stock returns (Phelps, 1972; Mayer, 2018), empirical testing of their ex-ante predictive power (Tortoriello, 
2008), exploratory analysis of the multibagger dataset, and the strength of the calculated correlation with 
future stock returns. These considerations led to the selection of the following groups of potential 
explanatory variables: 
▪ Earnings growth: Analysed growth in revenue; gross, operating, net profit, and EBITDA; growth 
of free cash flow, earnings per share, and similar metrics. Also examined growth in assets, equity, 
capital, and tangible book value. Both year-on-year short-term growth rates, longer term cumulative 
growth, and 5-year CAGR rates were considered. 
▪ Valuation: Various ratios such as B/M, P/E, P/S, P/B, FCF/P, EV/EBITDA, EV/FCF, EV/sales. 
20 
▪ Profitability: ROC, ROE, ROA; gross, net, operating profit margins, EBITDA margin, levered 
and unlevered FCF margin; and other less conventional metrics.  
▪ Quality: Earnings quality (measured as levered FCF / operating income ratio), cash ROIC (FCF / 
capital ratio) – both reflecting the firm’s ability to convert profit recognised in financial statements 
into actual disposable funds – and the firm’s profitability compared to industry averages. 
▪ Capital allocation: Dividend yield, debt increase and reduction, new share issuance and buybacks. 
▪ Indebtedness, liquidity, solvency (‘red flags’): Long-term and total debt to equity ratios, debt / 
capital, debt cover, EBITDA/interest expense ratio, current and quick ratios, and Altman score. 
▪ Technical factors: Momentum (1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 36-month) and 12-month price range.  
▪ Other variables: Apart from the conventional risk-free 3-month T-bill rate and market return on 
the S&P 500 index, analysed the impact of the interest rate environment (Fed rate and its changes), 
business cycle stages (reflected by dummies), firms’ R&D and marketing ‘propensity’ (measured 
as the proportion of profit spent on R&D or marketing accordingly), various investment dummies 
(e.g., those indicating whether asset growth exceeds cash flow or EBITDA growth), analyst 
coverage (to test the common belief that a multibagger company must be relatively unknown), 
various comparisons with prime industry metrics, and time effects. 
Overall, the impact of more than 150 variables and their lags on multibagger returns was examined. 
The dependent variable in all models is the annual risk-adjusted stock price return (measured here as stock 
price return minus risk-free return). All models were estimated using data from 2000 to 2022. Two years 
of observations (2023-2024) were reserved to evaluate the models’ out-of-sample predictive power, using 
models’ root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and Chow’s second predictive 
failure test (Chow, 1960). 
Preliminary diagnostic tests indicated the presence of heteroscedasticity and first-order autocorrelation in 
the data. The modified Wald test for groupwise heteroscedasticity in fixed effect regression resulted in 
prob=0.000, hence the null hypothesis (H0) of homoscedasticity was rejected at 1%; the Wooldridge test 
for autocorrelation in panel data produced a prob=0.015, hence H0 of no autocorrelation was also rejected 
at the 5% level. Consequently, the cluster() option was employed in Stata code to control for both 
heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation, ensuring accurate error estimates in both static and dynamic models. 
The resulting best parsimonious models, which are theoretically sound, have passed diagnostic tests, and 
exhibit excellent predictive power, are employed for further analysis. 
The next subsections explain the differences between static and dynamic specifications and provide a 
discussion on the most appropriate estimating techniques for the panel dataset utilised in this study. 
Static models of future stock returns (panel regressions with fixed effects) 
The basic form of the static panel regression can be written as:  
�
�𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽1𝑋1,𝑖𝑡−1 + 𝛽2𝑋2,𝑖𝑡−1 + …+ 𝛽𝑘𝑋𝑘,𝑖𝑡−1 + 𝜇𝑖 +𝜖𝑖𝑡, 
where: 
�
�𝑖𝑡 is the annual return on firm i stock in year t, 
(4) 
�
�1…𝑘,𝑖𝑡−1 represent exposures to factors that drive stock returns (such as size, value, profitability 
etc.) for firm i at time t-1, 
�
�1…𝑘 are the regression coefficients or payoffs to a relevant factor, 
�
�𝑖 is the unobserved firm-specific fixed effect that captures time-invariant characteristics specific 
to each company (e.g., corporate culture, visionary CEO, efficient decision-making and so on), 
21 
�
�𝑖𝑡 is the idiosyncratic error term that captures firm- and time-specific variation not explained by 
the model’s predictors.  
Dynamic models of future stock returns: alternative functional forms for large N small T 
panels 
A dynamic model is a model in which the current value of the dependent variable Yt is a function of a set 
of independent variables X1…k and its own past values. In other words, an additional lagged dependent 
variable 𝑌𝑖,𝑡−1 that captures the dynamic relationship in introduced on the RHS: 
�
�𝑖𝑡 = 𝜃𝑌 𝑖,𝑡−1 + 𝛽1𝑋1,𝑖𝑡−1 + 𝛽2𝑋2,𝑖𝑡−1 + …+ 𝛽𝑘𝑋𝑘,𝑖𝑡−1 + 𝜇𝑖 + 𝜖𝑖𝑡, 
(5) 
The inclusion of lags of Y on the right-hand side is appropriate in situations where the time series exhibit 
inertia as it allows to better capture the dynamics of the adjustment process. This might be particularly 
relevant for modelling stock returns where the momentum effect is well-documented – see, for example, 
the seminal paper by Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) or application to mutual funds by Carhart (1997) and 
other asset classes by Asness et al. (2013). Apart from improving model specification, the dynamic 
modelling framework enables Granger causality testing to determine whether, after controlling for past 
values of Y, past values of X help to forecast Y, indicating that X Granger-causes Y (Wooldridge, 2022). 
This feature is essential for identifying factors that actively drive future stock returns rather than merely 
correlating with them.  
In empirical modelling the equation (5) is transformed to eliminate the unobserved fixed effect 𝜇𝑖 using 
within transformation or first differencing (Baltagi, 2021). Both transformations have their merits and can 
be appropriate in different scenarios (depending on a particular panel structure, number of entities within a 
panel N and time periods T). Two approaches result in a slightly different model structure and require 
different estimation techniques.  
Within (or fixed effects) transformation involves demeaning the variables across time by subtracting the 
firm-specific means over time for each variable (Wooldridge, 2010). Since term 𝜇𝑖 is constant over time, 
the difference between 𝜇𝑖 and its mean over observation period 𝜇̅ 𝑖 is zero which effectively eliminates this

(6.1) 
where terms 𝑌̅𝑖, 𝑋̅𝑖 and 𝜖̅ 𝑖 denote means of relevant variables for firm i over all time periods. This 
transformation is preferred when the unobserved individual heterogeneity is assumed to be correlated with 
the regressors. However, the current consensus is that the within estimator produces biased and inconsistent 
results for panels with small T (Baltagi, 2022). 
The alternative first differencing (FD) approach eliminates the unobserved time-invariant effects 𝜇𝑖 by 
subtracting the previous period’s values from the current period’s values for each variable (Anderson and 
Hsiao, 1982), and yields the following equation:  
�
�𝑖𝑡−𝑌𝑖,𝑡−1 = 𝜃̈ (𝑌𝑖,𝑡−1−𝑌𝑖,𝑡−2) + 𝛽̈ 1(𝑋1,𝑡−1−𝑋1,𝑡−2) + 𝛽̈ 2(𝑋2,𝑡−1−𝑋2,𝑡−2) + …+

This transformation removes the time-invariant fixed effect 𝜇𝑖 and produces consistent estimates, however, 
the differenced lag ∆𝑌 𝑖,𝑡−1 on the RHS in model (7.1) introduces potential endogeneity as it is corelated 
with the error term ∆𝜖𝑖𝑡. The endogeneity problem necessitates the use of instrumental variables estimators, 
which use deeper lags in differenced form ∆𝑌𝑖,𝑡−2 = 𝑌𝑖,𝑡−2−𝑌𝑖,𝑡−3 or simply levels 𝑌𝑖,𝑡−2 as instruments for 
∆𝑌𝑖,𝑡−1 (as they are uncorrelated with the error term ∆𝜖𝑖𝑡). 
Arellano and Bond (1991) proposed a more efficient generalized method of moments procedure 
(difference GMM) than the earlier Anderson and Hsiao (1982) estimator, which has since become highly 
popular in empirical modelling of dynamic panel data. The Arellano-Bond estimator (the xtabond command 
in Stata) uses lagged levels of the dependent variable as instruments for the first-differenced lagged 
dependent variable. It is designed for datasets with many panels and few time periods (that is particularly 
suitable for the multibagger sample under consideration with N=464 and T=25). However, it relies on the 
assumption of no autocorrelation in the idiosyncratic errors, requiring separate verification. One- and two
step versions of this estimator exists: one-step estimator assumes homoscedasticity, while two-step 
procedure accounts for heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation making it asymptotically more efficient but 
requires a larger sample.  
The newer system GMM estimator, proposed by Arellano and Bover (1995) and fully developed by 
Blundell and Bond (1998), extends the difference GMM method by combining equations in levels (5) and 
differences (7) in the system of simultaneous equations. System GMM uses both lagged levels as 
instruments for the differenced equation as in the Arellano-Bond estimator, and lagged differences as 
instruments for the level equation (the xtdpdsys Stata command). This approach increases the number of 
moment conditions reducing bias and improving the efficiency of the estimator. It is particularly 
advantageous when the dependent variable is highly persistent. In other words, when Y has a strong 
autoregressive component and changes slowly over time, system GMM mitigates the weak instrument 
problem that affects difference GMM in such cases. Like the original Arellano-Bond estimator, system 
GMM is recommended for datasets with large number of panel units N and relatively small number of time 
periods T. This estimator requires an assumption that there is no autocorrelation in the idiosyncratic errors. 
Roodman (2009) proposes an alternative version of the system GMM estimator that is also suitable for the 
multibagger sample under consideration (xtabond2 Stata command). This approach is designed to deal with 
cases where idiosyncratic errors are heteroskedastic and correlated within (i.e., over time for each individual 
firm) but not across panel units. It provides more flexibility in manually specifying range of lags, collapsing 
them and explicitly classifying variables as strictly exogenous, endogenous or predetermined. The two-step 
version further improves the estimation efficiency in large samples but added complexity might be not 
justified for smaller panels. 
The choice between these estimators depends on the structure of the data and the assumptions made 
regarding the error term, which can be rather subjective and not always fully testable. Therefore, all 
specifications described above were estimated and then compared to identify common inferences. 
The results are reported in Table 4 below. All models have been tested for the validity of instruments used 
in the estimation process (using Arellano-Bond autocorrelation test, Sargan / Hansen test of overidentifying 
restrictions and Difference-in-Hansen test). Postestimation diagnostic tests which can be calculated for 
dynamic panel models do not provide clear guidance on which specification is “true” or “better” as was the 
case with more straightforward static models. As information criteria used for model selection cannot be 
calculated for dynamic IV models, and the R2 is not interpretable in this context, they are not reported. 
23 
Table 5. Comparison of static and dynamic models of future stock returns    
24 
The estimation results include both expected findings and unique insights. 
As can be seen from table 5, all estimated coefficients have expected signs apart from a single variable 
(earnings quality) in Model 3. This model (FE Within estimator) contains three additional regressors that 
do not appear in other specifications: earnings quality, EV/sales and EV/EBITDA valuation ratios. All these 
additional explanatory variables, although statistically significant, have low estimated coefficients, 
implying that their role in driving future stock returns is relatively small. These variables were removed 
from the set of regressors in other specifications as a part of the general-to-specific elimination process as 
they became statistically insignificant when alternative IV estimation methods were used. The same is true 
for 1-month and 3-month momentum variables – they turned out to be significant in only one of the 
specifications (model 6).  
The current market return on S&P 500 is significant in all models and has a positive sign, implying 
that the portfolio of multibagger stocks moves in line with the rest of the market. The estimated coefficient 
varies from 0.54 to 0.93, which is consistent with the conventional asset pricing theory.  
As in previously discussed Fama-French type models, the size factor proxied by logged TEV is strongly 
significant. It appears in all regressions and has a negative coefficient as suggested by Fama-French theory, 
suggesting that the bigger the size of the company, the lower future stock price growth tends to be (ceteris 
paribus). The coefficient size varies significantly across specifications though suggesting that the extent of 
its influence on stock returns is less certain. 
The profitability factor is also significant. When the dynamic processes are explicitly accounted for, the 
EBITDA profit margin (that was the preferred profitability metric in the upgraded five-factor model and 
static models 1-2) becomes statistically insignificant and is replaced by ROA in dynamic models 3-7. None 
of other variables that could potentially be used as a proxy for profitability or efficiency (such as 
gross/net/operating profit margin, ROE, ROC, or cash ROIC) were statistically significant in any of the 
dynamic models. The estimated coefficient is consistent with the theoretical predictions: it suggests that, 
controlling for other factors, more profitable companies with higher ROA deliver higher future stock 
returns, however, the size of this coefficient is rather small (between 0.4 and 1.9 only). Notably, one of the 
main explanatory variables with the highest impact on future returns which is found to be strongly 
significant (FCF/P) can also be interpreted as a measure of profitability. 
Growth variables that were tested turned out to be insignificant in the dynamic modelling process. This 
includes both past-year growth rates and longer-term 5-year CAGR rates. Growth of EBITDA, EPS, and 
FCF per share variables are insignificant and were not included in the final parsimonious models. Thus, 
the suggestion from the popular literature that to deliver high share price growth, the company must 
demonstrate significant growth of earnings for extended period, is not supported by the empirical evidence, 
which is surprising. Growth of assets rate (representing the Fama-French investment factor) is statistically 
significant in 3 out of 7 specifications, but the estimated coefficient is not high (0.08-0.24) suggesting a 
limited impact on future returns.  
The investment dummy4, however, is negative and strongly significant in both static and dynamic 
frameworks. It reveals a specific investment pattern for multibagger stocks: if the growth of assets 
exceeds the growth of EBITDA in a particular year, stock returns above risk-free rates next year 
tend to be 4-11 percentage points lower (controlling for other factors). In other words, firms must invest 
and grow their assets; however, the investment must remain affordable and covered by growing EBITDA. 
This influence appears important for high-performing stocks – this unique finding of this study. 
The interest environment dummy5 turned out to be insignificant in the conventional IV models (models 3 
and 4) and was eliminated during general-to-specific modelling process; however, it remained strongly 
4Inv dummy =1 if year-on-year growth of assets exceeds year-on-year growth of EBITDA, = 0 otherwise. 
5Interest environment dummy = 1 if the Fed rate is growing in a particular year, =0 otherwise. 
25 
significant when more advanced GMM estimators were used. This variable suggests that controlling for 
other factors, when interest rates are increasing, this macroeconomic environment depresses the 
return of multibagger stocks above risk-free rate next year by approximately 8-12 percentage points.  
The negative impact of rising interest rates on growth stocks is well-documented (see, for example, 
Bernanke and Kuttner, 2005) and straightforward to interpret. The market value of a listed company 
depends on the present value of its future cash flows. Spikes in interest rates not only increase the cost of 
capital for firms but also raise the discount rate used in present value calculations, thereby depressing 
company valuations. This effect is more pronounced in growth ('hot' or 'glamour') stocks, which often rely 
on promised earnings projected into the distant future, compared to 'value' companies. Consequently, 
growth stocks are more adversely affected by increases in discount rates. As changes in the interest 
environment dummy variable affects all stocks in the sample and is not company-specific, it would not be 
useful for stock selection purposes but can still enhance returns forecasts for high-growth stocks.  
The value factor appears to be playing the biggest role in explaining stock returns both in static and 
dynamic specifications. The value factor is represented by two main variables: book-to-market (B/M) as in 
Fama-French models and a new FCF-to-price (FCF/P) ratio6. These variables have the highest coefficients 
in absolute terms, positive sign as expected, and strongly statistically significant. They deliver a very clear 
message that the future price return is strongly related to company valuation. An increase in the company’s 
B/M and FCF/P ratios of 1% is associated with a 7-52% increase in future share price return. Interestingly, 
this implies that the growth vs value debate in the investment industry might be meaningless: as high
growth stocks must also be value stocks to demonstrate their superiority!  
As mentioned earlier, two further valuation variables (EV/sales and EV/EBITDA) turned out to be 
significant in one of the models (the within estimator) but not in more intricate modelling frameworks. The 
valuation ratio P/E which is most commonly used in the industry to describe a valuation of the stock, turned 
out to be not useful in the quantitative empirical analysis and not predictive of future returns. Not only this 
variable was statistically insignificant when included among regressors, it also tended to skew other 
coefficients dramatically. The P/E ratio is problematic for the modelling purposes for two reasons. First, 
the company might have negative earnings (i.e., loss-making), making the P/E ratio not interpretable for 
this period, reducing the number of data points available for analysis. This reduces the sample to profit
making companies only. Secondly, when company earnings are very small, the denominator (E in the ratio) 
can be close to zero, forcing the ratio itself tend to infinity. These extreme values of P/E cannot be 
considered outliers as they are valid observations, but their presence make running regression problematic. 
That is why P/E as a measure of value was avoided in this study. 
Technical factors and momentum play a noticeable role in explaining future stock returns. The 
impact is complex and highly dynamic, implying that multibagger stocks have a term structure of 
expected returns, and the pattern is not as beneficial as commonly assumed by the industry. According to 
the Momentum Investing idea, share prices exhibit strong persistence over time and tend to follow a trend: 
the stocks that grew in the recent past will continue to grow in the near future, and similarly, declining 
stocks tend to underperform in the future (Jegadeesh and Titman, 1993; Asness et al., 2013). The analysis 
of multibagger shows that this momentum effect (if present) is only short-lived: 1-month momentum is the 
only variable that has a positive coefficient, and it is only significant in a single model. All other momentum 
regressors (3- and 6-month) are negative, suggesting a quick trend reversal process for multibagger stocks. 
In other words, if a stock had was growing in the preceding 3-6 months, it is more likely to decline in the 
next year.  The price range variable7 is also negative and strongly statistically significant, indicating that 
6The FCF/P ratio (also called free cash flow yield) is a valuation, and a profitability metric used to assess the 
attractiveness of a stock based on its cash-generating ability relative to its share price. 
7Price range shows how close the current stock price is to its 12-month high and is calculated as (current price – 12
month low) / (12-month high – 12-month low) x 100%. The variable varies from 0 (if the current price is the 12-month 
lowest) to 100% (if the current price is equal to 12-month high). 
26 
the closer the current stock price to its 12-month high, the lower next year’s price return tends to be. 
These findings align with the Overreaction Hypothesis (De Bondt and Thaler, 1985; Zhang and Li, 2024; 
Singh and Kaur, 2024). 
Numerous other variables were tested as a part of the general-to-specific modelling approach but were 
found to be insignificant. Specifically, the indebtedness and soundness of financial position (debt-to
capital ratio, debt cover), solvency (Altman score), and capital allocation decisions (debt increase, share 
buybacks, dividend repayments) were found to be insignificant for future stock returns. Dividend yield 
turned out to be significant in static models but not in dynamic framework. This is an interesting finding as 
it implies that multibagger stocks tend to provide both abnormal capital appreciation and dividend income 
to investors. In fact, at the beginning of the observation period, 58% of multibagger companies paid 
dividends, growing to 78% of the sample by January 2024. The author’s own ‘R&D propensity’ variable8 
was also tested: the hypothesis was that companies that invest a large proportion of available funds into 
developing new innovative products and ideas should demonstrate higher share price growth; however, this 
idea was not supported by the empirical evidence. 
Granger causality in stock returns 
As lags of independent variables 𝑋1…𝑘,𝑖𝑡−1 discussed above turned out to be statistically significant in the 
explanatory regressions of stock returns 𝑌𝑖𝑡, one can conclude that variables 𝑿𝟏…𝒌 Granger-cause Y. In 
other words, the factors identified in this study drive future returns of multibagger stocks. They are not 
simply associated or correlated with increasing returns, they are predictive of future stock performance. 
The forecasting power of estimated models is discussed in more detail in the next section. 
6.4. Predictive power and out-of-sample forecasting 
All regressions mentioned above were estimated using the data for 2000-22, with 2023-24 observations 
reserved for out-of-sample forecasting. The estimated parameters from the training period were then used 
to predict future stock returns both in-sample and out-of-sample. Forecasting performance was evaluated 
separately during bull and bear markets, and in different interest rate environments (when interest rates are 
increasing – the environment that tends to depress growth stocks – and when interest rates are stable or 
declining). The means of the forecasts are shown in Figure 3 (the out-of-sample prediction period is shaded), 
and some further forecasting statistics is available in Appendix Table A1. 
As can be seen from the graphs of observed and predicted values, the estimated models trace the direction 
of market change out-of-sample very well: both the portfolio share prices decline in 2023 and the 
consequent growth in 2024 were forecasted with remarkable accuracy. In-sample forecasting power is 
also notable: at the very beginning of the observation period in 2002 when not enough training data were 
available yet, the model could not pick up the direction of portfolio returns but this quickly improved 
starting from 2003 onwards.  
Interestingly, the models are overly pessimistic both in times of bear and bull markets, overstating the 
extent of predicted portfolio decline (e.g., low in 2023) and underestimating the extent of predicted portfolio 
rise (for example, peaks in stock performance in 2004 and 2010). All of the models predicted a decline in 
stock performance in 2021 (which is interesting given that the market turmoil during this period was caused 
by the pandemic - the “black swan” event which is completely unpredictable by definition. All models were 
overly pessimistic forecasting between 6.4% to 15.6% mean portfolio returns while the actual return 
8Measured as a percentage of available cash allocated to R&D expenditure (=R&D expense / Levered FCF x 100%). 
27 
amounted to 41.6%. The only year in which the model significantly overstated the portfolio performance is 
2013 (the models predicted between 52.5% to 63.9% share price growth while the realised return was 38.4% 
only). However, this local portfolio high was indeed achieved a year later: in other words, the models were 
able to foresee the increased returns but the portfolio took one year longer than expected to achieve these. 
Throughout the whole forecasting exercise, there was not a single year when the models predicted an 
increase in stock prices while the stocks would fall in reality – which is reassuring for investors.  
Figure 3. Mean returns of multibagger stock portfolio vs predicted values vs S&P 500 returns 
It is also interesting to see how the models’ predictive power is affected by the changing macroeconomic 
interest rate environment. While the estimated models tend to be overly pessimistic (the average forecasting 
error across all models over all forecasted periods is negative at -6.63%), they are noticeably more 
pessimistic in a stable or declining interest rates environment (the average forecasting error for these periods 
increases to -9.92% – see Table A1 in Appendix). When the Fed increases its rate, the models pick the 
negative effects of higher discount rates on growth stocks very well, and the average forecasting error drops 
to mere a 1.68% in absolute terms.  
To summarise, the estimated models systematically underestimate the extent of future portfolio 
performance. The predictive performance of models is biased, however, the direction of this bias is 
consistent across all models and all forecasting periods. It still provides valuable information and, in fact, 
the direction of this forecasting bias is favourable for investors who might attempt to use this model in 
investment decisions. In all cases, the estimated models tend to err on the side of caution, especially during 
periods of extreme volatility in the markets (periods of extreme highs or extreme lows) predicting lower 
risk-adjusted returns than actual realised returns, which is arguably a good thing for an investor as it 
provides some built-in margin of safety.

7. Implications and conclusion 
Summary of key findings 
This paper focuses on a comprehensive analysis of a specific type of stock – multibagger stocks listed on 
major U.S. stock exchanges that increased in value by at least tenfold from 2009 to 2024. The panel data 
analysis of 464 multibaggers identified during this period pinpointed several significant factors that explain 
the sources of their outperformance relative to market averages. The findings indicate that several 
traditional Fama-French factors, including size, value, and profitability, remain significant determinants of 
future multibagger returns. Additionally, the analysis identifies other important drivers of stock 
outperformance. These include fundamental, technical, and macroeconomic variables, such as high free 
cash flow yield, distinctive investment patterns, complex momentum effects with quick trend reversals, and 
a specific interest rate environment, which are essential for growth stocks to demonstrate their full potential. 
A summary of the key findings is provided below: 
▪ Many common beliefs related to multibagger stocks are not supported by empirical evidence (for 
instance, the assumption that strong earnings growth is necessary for significant stock appreciation). 
▪ Small-cap, high-value, and high-profitability stocks tend to outperform, supporting the Fama and 
French (2015) factor investing principles and their applicability to high-growth investment strategies. 
▪ Aggressive investment is beneficial for stock growth; however, it must be supported by 
corresponding increases in EBITDA. An aggressive investment strategy only reduces future returns 
when a firm expands its asset base at a rate exceeding its earnings growth, indicating a more complex 
interaction between investment spending and future stock performance than is typically postulated by 
traditional factor models. 
▪ Robust cash flow yield is the most important driver of multibagger stock outperformance. 
▪ Macroeconomic factors, such as interest rates, significantly influence returns; for example, a rising 
Fed interest rate depresses the next-year stock returns by 10.1%.  
▪ Momentum effects are important; however, the share price dynamics of multibagger stocks are 
complex, characterised by rapid trend reversals. The closer the current stock price is to its 12-month 
high, the lower the next-year price return tends to be.  
▪ The entry point is critical for future returns. Specifically, the stock should be close to its 12
month low at the time of purchase and, ideally, have fallen in price considerably in the preceding 
six months.  
▪ The observed fundamental features of listed companies and their recent performance reliably 
predict future stock returns, challenging the Efficient Market Hypothesis.  
Contribution to academic literature 
The empirical investigation reveals several unique findings that have not been previously published, such 
as the effects of cash flow yield and the distinctive investment patterns of multibagger companies. This 
research makes substantial contributions to both academic literature and investment practice. It advances 
existing theories is financial economics by focusing on a niche subset of stocks and testing established 
asset pricing models with novel empirical evidence, thereby offering a more comprehensive 
understanding of the factors driving exceptional stock returns. Additionally, it proposes data-driven ideas 
for enhancing factor-based investment strategies. 
29 
Refinement of existing asset pricing models and novel return factors: This research confirms that the 
traditional Fama-French factors – size, value, and profitability – remain significant determinants of future 
multibagger returns, demonstrating that smaller, undervalued companies with higher profitability metrics 
typically outperform. However, it goes beyond these traditional models by identifying additional unique 
explanatory variables: high free cash flow yield, aggressive investment linked to EBITDA growth, stable 
interest rate environments, and entry stock price close to its 12-month low. 
These novel factors are crucial for predicting stock outperformance and systematic stock selection for high
growth portfolios. This integration challenges the conventional wisdom within asset pricing literature, 
which primarily focuses on surface-level financial metrics. The findings show that while traditional 
fundamental factors form a necessary foundation, they alone are insufficient for identifying the 
highest performing stocks within the stock universe. 
Empirical testing of previous assumptions treated as axioms: Contrary to many practitioner-oriented 
publications that lack rigorous statistical analysis (such as Phelps (1972), Lynch (1988), and Mayer (2018)), 
this study employs robust econometric methods and provides statistical evidence that supports the 
significance of certain investment characteristics and disproves other commonly held beliefs based on 
intellectual speculation or anecdotal examples. Most notably, it found that earnings growth – in all forms: 
growth of earnings per share, sales, gross, operating, and net profit, cash flow, both year-on-year and longer
term 5-year cumulative growth, as well as 5-year CAGR rates – was statistically insignificant in predicting 
future multibagger returns (Section 6.3). These findings echo Tortoriello’s (2008) observation that variables 
effective at explaining past stock performance frequently lose predictive power when modelling future 
returns. By providing quantitative support for popular qualitative assertions, this study fills a significant 
gap in the existing literature on multibagger stocks and advances our understanding of the true drivers of 
superior stock returns. 
Inclusion of macroeconomic variables in the modelling framework: This study demonstrates that 
macroeconomic conditions, specifically, interest rate environments, have a substantial impact on 
multibagger stock returns – a factor, although well-known, often overlooked in traditional asset pricing 
models. Interest rates adjustments are the key monetary policy tool used by central banks, which transmit 
to the economy primarily by influencing costs of borrowing. These changes, in turn, influence incentives 
to save and invest, the future profitability of the corporate sector, and overall economic activity. Financial 
markets are at the centre of this transmission mechanism, with equity prices being particularly sensitive to 
interest rate fluctuations, as demonstrated by Bernanke and Kuttner (2005), among many others. However, 
factor model studies that explicitly incorporate interest rates or other macroeconomic variables to predict 
future stock returns are less common (Jensen and Mercer, 2002). By addressing this gap, this study provides 
deeper insights into how macroeconomic factors influence growth stock returns and reduces the risk of 
omitted variables bias in traditional multi-factor models. 
Refining the impact of the investment factor: Contrary to the traditional Fama-French model (2015), 
which postulates a negative relationship between active investment and future stock returns, this study finds 
that aggressive investment can drive multibagger stock growth if it is accompanied by equivalent increases 
in EBITDA. Aggressive investment is only detrimental to stock returns when it exceeds the firm's financial 
capacity, highlighting that affordability is more critical than the aggressiveness of the investment policy 
itself. The investment patterns observed in multibagger stocks challenge the conventional propositions of 
multi-factor models and reveal a more nuanced interaction between investment spending and future stock 
prices. This could significantly influence how investment decisions are evaluated in both financial theory 
and practice. 
Complex momentum effects and market efficiency: The discovery of complex non-linear dynamic 
effects, which demonstrate that multibagger stocks exhibit a term structure of returns with rapid trend 
reversals, challenges the simplistic application of momentum strategies in asset management. This finding 
indicates that the timing of trades plays a critical role in realising heavily outsized returns and necessitates 
30 
a more sophisticated approach to stock selection and portfolio formation – one that explicitly identifies 
advantageous entry points. Moreover, the insights on characteristics distinguishing high-performing stocks 
provide a basis for developing exit strategies to mitigate the risk of rapid trend reversals, which is crucial 
for managing the volatility of high-growth stocks. Additionally, the term structure of returns identified in 
this study questions the extent to which markets efficiently incorporate past price information into current 
stock prices, thereby contributing to the academic debate on market anomalies. 
Implications to investment practice 
The insights derived from this study significantly enhance the toolkit available to investors and asset 
managers seeking to identify potential multibaggers. These findings have substantial implications for 
investment practice, particularly in the development and refinement of practical investment strategies and 
systematic stock selection methods. 
The excellent forecasting performance of the estimated model, which accurately captures the performance 
of the multibagger portfolio both in-sample and out-of-sample, demonstrates that the observed fundamental 
characteristics of listed companies and their recent stock performance can reliably predict future stock 
returns. These findings explicitly challenge the Efficient Market Hypothesis by suggesting that the U.S. 
stock market does not fully price in publicly available information about listed stocks, thus indicating that 
it is not entirely efficient. This insight is promising for investors seeking alpha, as it implies that market 
inefficiencies can be exploited to achieve abnormal returns. Moreover, these results confirm the 
effectiveness of both fundamental and technical analysis as valuable tools for practical investment 
decision-making, stock selection, and portfolio management. 
Refinement of investment strategies linked to business cycles: The impact of macroeconomic 
conditions, particularly interest rates, on stock performance reinforces the need for a dynamic asset 
allocation approach that actively adjusts to economic cycles. Asset managers and individual investors may 
benefit from altering their portfolio exposure to growth vs. value stocks based on predicted economic 
conditions, potentially enhancing their return profiles. However, it should be noted that although portfolios 
with a focus on multibagger stocks experience reduced returns during periods of rising interest rates, they 
have been shown to outperform the market across all economic conditions (Section 6.4). This suggests that 
careful selection of stocks based on their fundamental and technical factors can still generate alpha, despite 
an adverse macroeconomic environment. 
Development of a practical stock screener: The dynamic panel data model developed in this study 
establishes a theoretically sound and empirically validated quantitative framework for devising an effective 
stock screening strategy, aimed at identifying potential future stock market winners and maximising capital 
gains. The insights into the factors that drive multibagger returns can be incorporated into a usable stock 
screener model that surpasses traditional financial metrics, such as those proposed by Piotroski (2000) and 
Mohanram (2004). By screening for companies that exhibit characteristics similar to historical 
multibaggers, investors can systematically identify stocks with the potential to yield returns significantly 
above market averages. The development of such a screener will be the subject of the author’s future 
research in this field. Thus, this research makes a significant contribution to investment practice by bridging 
the gap between theoretical discussions on asset pricing and practical investment decision-making. 
Limitations and directions for further research 
Although this study has made significant progress in our understanding of the unique features of 
multibagger stocks, like all research, it possesses inherent limitations. Numerous intriguing questions 
remain unaddressed, representing a fruitful field for future investigation that could further enrich both the 
academic and practical knowledge base, thereby advancing the field of empirical asset pricing. 
31 
Global validation of findings: The focus on U.S. stock exchanges might restrict the applicability of the 
predictive model in other markets, particularly in countries with differing economic systems or regulatory 
environments. Future studies could investigate whether the drivers of American multibagger returns 
maintain their significance across global markets, especially in emerging economies. 
Sector-specific studies: Given the varying dynamics across different industries, sector-specific studies 
could provide deeper insights into the drivers of multibagger outperformance within specific industries and 
market segments. For example, the technology sector may exhibit distinct characteristics that require 
adjustments to the model. Conversely, industrials, healthcare, or consumer cyclicals might respond to 
unique drivers of stock performance that are not relevant for tech companies. Furthermore, financials, such 
as banks and asset management companies, which have distinct balance sheet compositions, require 
different metrics of fundamental analysis compared to non-financial sectors. Investigating these variances 
can refine predictive models, more accurately account for industry-specific risks, and tailor investment 
strategies, potentially boosting portfolio returns.  
Impact of disruptive technological innovations: Given the rapid pace of technological transformation 
that disrupts traditional industries and business practices, the factors currently identified as key drivers of 
stock market outperformance may evolve over time. As existing companies give way to new market leaders 
that offer innovative products and services, the significance of traditional metrics, such as asset growth in 
driving company stock performance, might diminish as firms’ operations become increasingly digitalised. 
Simultaneously, new factors – such as the author’s 'R&D propensity' or marketing expenditure – may gain 
greater explanatory power. Therefore, future longitudinal studies should investigate how technological 
advancements alter the characteristics of multibagger stocks and periodically update the estimated 
parameters of the model. 
Integration with artificial intelligence methods: Leveraging AI and machine learning techniques could 
significantly enhance the predictive power of the stock screening model. As Shmueli (2011) explains, there 
are fundamental differences between explanatory and predictive modelling, leading to completely distinct 
research paths – from variations in data collection to differing techniques of model validation and optimal 
model selection, necessitating the use of specific statistical methods tailored to the research aim. Since this 
study primarily aimed to identify factors that drive (i.e., explain and cause) multibagger stock returns, a 
dynamic panel regression framework was utilised. This approach was chosen due to ease of interpretation 
of estimated coefficients and the opportunities for theory building based on the results. 
Alternative predictive model building approaches, such as neural networks, random forests, data 
compression methods, boosting, and ensemble methods, while challenging to interpret, may deliver 
superior predictive accuracy. If the primary research objective were to forecast rather than explain future 
multibagger returns, AI algorithms could be trained on a larger dataset to detect subtle patterns and 
correlations that may not be evident through traditional econometric models. Thus, the application of AI to 
the multibagger dataset could yield further promising insights. 
Use of alternative data sources and inclusion of investor sentiment: Incorporating non-traditional data 
sources and analytical approaches, such as sentiment analysis from social media and news trends 
(potentially with the use of AI), along with additional explanatory variables that represent investor 
psychology, could significantly enhance the model’s predictive capabilities and provide a more precise 
understanding of the factors influencing multibagger stock prices.  
The widespread adoption of online investment platforms and mobile apps, such as Robinhood, Webull, 
Charles Schwab, and Interactive Brokers, after the COVID pandemic has democratised access to financial 
markets, amplifying the impact of retail investor sentiment on stock prices, particularly noticeable in 
32 
"glamour", “meme” or "Reddit" stocks. As more individuals engage in stock trading via these platforms9, 
the collective mood, emotions (fear/greed/panic), herding influences, and psychological biases captured 
through unconventional channels may become significant predictors of market movements. This trend 
towards an increasing role of retail investors underscores the need to include market sentiment regressors 
in the quantitative modelling framework in future research. 
Conclusion 
To sum up, this study significantly enriches the field of financial economics by providing new empirical 
evidence that challenges and refines existing asset pricing theories. The novel incorporation of stock
specific fundamental characteristics, past pricing information, and macroeconomic factors into traditional 
models offers a more sophisticated understanding of the drivers of extraordinary stock returns. This study 
not only refines existing asset pricing theories but also lays a solid foundation for future research and the 
practical application to development of investment strategies, aimed at identifying high-growth 
opportunities and generating alpha in the stock market. 
9According to Reuters (2021), individual investors accounted for over 25% of the U.S. equity trading volume in 2020. 
There were over 100 million retail users at just six of the most popular online brokerages. Furthermore, total client 
assets at the two leading retail-focused brokerages amounted to $15.5 trillion – compared to total capitalisation of the 
U.S. stock market of approximately $40.7 trillion (Index Mundi).
