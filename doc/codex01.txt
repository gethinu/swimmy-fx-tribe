# codex01.txt (redacted)

This file previously contained operational transcripts that included secrets
(for example, Discord webhook URLs). Discord webhook tokens are embedded in
the URL, so treating them as secrets is required.

What changed:
- The original content was removed to prevent further leakage.

How to keep local notes safely:
- Put local-only notes under a git-ignored file, e.g. `doc/codex01.local.txt`.
- Never paste private keys, Discord bot tokens, webhook URLs, API keys, or OTPs
  into tracked files.

If a webhook URL was ever committed or logged, rotate it in Discord:
- Server Settings -> Integrations -> Webhooks -> Delete/Recreate
